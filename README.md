-Graceful degradation and service workers play a crucial role in enhancing the user experience of web applications. Graceful degradation ensures that an application remains functional and accessible, even if certain advanced features are not supported by the user's browser or device. This approach prioritizes core functionality and provides fallback options to maintain usability. Service workers, on the other hand, are a powerful tool for managing network requests, caching assets, and enabling offline functionality. They intercept network requests and serve cached content when the user is offline or when the network is slow, thereby improving performance and reliability. By leveraging service workers, developers can create web applications that gracefully degrade, ensuring a seamless experience across a wide range of devices and network conditions.
